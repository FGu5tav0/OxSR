## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Change of importance in authorship, all from "ctb" to "aut"

* Removed the execution time test in `relation_hm_gt()`

* Code correction in `relation_hm_gt()`: previously, the points in the plot were not updated when changing the `pv_tolerance` parameter in the function

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
